### Anthem Virtual Tours


URL:  https://virtualtoursanthemny.netlify.app/


About the Project

By creating an in depth virtual tour experience. Potential renters can get a feel of the building called the Anthem which is loacted at 222 E 34th St New York Ny 10016. Quite often there are individuals abroad who need to secure housing prior to their arrival to NYC.  In these scenarios the person seeking a new home are unable to view apartments in person. 

These potential clients then need to hire a broker and pay a fee for the broker to view apartments on their behalf.

When these brokers go out to multiple buildings/apartments they will facetime their clients to show them the apartments.

Currently there is various forms of media such as photo, video, 3d walkthroughs and floorplans. The goal of this app is to combine all of these items into a single app instead of a user having to go to multiple websites. 

Currently it is an industry standard to have the videos, 3D tours(ie Matterport media), listing information and other forms of media in different places regardless of who is hosting the content.

By integrating all of this media into one platform. I believer that a user could have a superior experience in comparison to a facetime call.

Getting Started:

After contacting my office. I will redirect client to the app so that they can view the media in advance. 


Next Steps:

I would look to add additional features such as: 

-Authentication / login (so that the CRUD operations are only available to myself.)
-Chatbot
-Hosted Zoom Calls
-Online Application Integration
-Lease Signing Integration
-VR integration though simple cardboard app or sony headset. (figuring out how to get people to use media is tricky and figuring out a way to get people to use their existing devices in combination with media is even trickier.)

The end goal of this app will to make the entire leasing process hosted through this single app. The shortest path to the end is a straight line and making a process easy and efficient is the best way to do so. If I am get potential renters to utilize the media available and interact with us remotely. We can capture more clients with a higher rate of efficiency.

I am a big believer of a seamless user experience anf if I can integrate VR into the app using the "google cardboard app". It could be the next step in digitizing real estate sales.
